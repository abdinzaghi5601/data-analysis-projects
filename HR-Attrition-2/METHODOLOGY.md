# HR Analytics - Methodology & Technical Framework

## ðŸ“‹ Analytical Methodology

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation

#### **Data Source Characteristics**
- **Dataset**: HR Analytics employee database
- **Records**: 1,470+ employee records
- **Scope**: Multi-departmental analysis across Sales, R&D, and HR
- **Time Frame**: Comprehensive employee lifecycle data

#### **Data Quality Assessment**
```sql
-- Duplicate Detection Protocol
SELECT EmpID, COUNT(*) as duplicate_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY EmpID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY duplicate_count DESC;
```

### 2. Data Cleaning Framework

#### **Duplicate Elimination Process**
```sql
-- ROW_NUMBER() Method for Duplicate Removal
CREATE TABLE employees_clean AS
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT *,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY EmpID ORDER BY EmpID) as row_num
    FROM employees
) t
WHERE row_num = 1;
```

#### **Categorical Data Standardization**
- **Gender Normalization**: Unified to 'Male'/'Female' format
- **MaritalStatus Consistency**: Standardized to 'Single'/'Married'/'Divorced'
- **Boolean Field Alignment**: Harmonized to 'Yes'/'No' format
- **JobRole Capitalization**: Applied consistent title case formatting

### 3. Feature Engineering Strategy

#### **Derived Categorical Variables**
```sql
-- Income Category Creation
ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN IncomeCategory VARCHAR(20);
UPDATE employees
SET IncomeCategory = CASE 
    WHEN MonthlyIncome < 3000 THEN 'Low'
    WHEN MonthlyIncome BETWEEN 3000 AND 6000 THEN 'Medium'
    WHEN MonthlyIncome BETWEEN 6001 AND 10000 THEN 'High'
    ELSE 'Very High'
END;

-- Age Group Segmentation
ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN AgeGroup VARCHAR(20);
UPDATE employees
SET AgeGroup = CASE 
    WHEN Age < 25 THEN 'Under 25'
    WHEN Age BETWEEN 25 AND 34 THEN '25-34'
    WHEN Age BETWEEN 35 AND 44 THEN '35-44'
    WHEN Age BETWEEN 45 AND 54 THEN '45-54'
    ELSE '55+'
END;
```

### 4. Analytical Framework

#### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
1. **Attrition Rate**: Primary retention metric
2. **Job Satisfaction Score**: Employee engagement measure
3. **Average Monthly Income**: Compensation analysis metric
4. **Work-Life Balance Score**: Quality of work environment indicator
5. **Performance Rating**: Productivity assessment measure

#### **Analysis Dimensions**
- **Demographic Segmentation**: Age, gender, marital status
- **Organizational Structure**: Department, job role, job level
- **Performance Metrics**: Satisfaction, involvement, performance ratings
- **Compensation Analysis**: Salary levels, raises, stock options
- **Work Characteristics**: Overtime, travel, work-life balance

### 5. Statistical Analysis Approach

#### **Attrition Analysis Methodology**
```sql
-- Department-wise Attrition Calculation
SELECT 
    Department,
    COUNT(*) AS total_employees,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS attrition_count,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) AS attrition_rate
FROM employees
GROUP BY Department
ORDER BY attrition_rate DESC;
```

#### **Correlation Analysis Framework**
- **Satisfaction vs. Attrition**: Inverse relationship assessment
- **Overtime Impact**: Work-life balance effect quantification
- **Salary vs. Retention**: Compensation adequacy evaluation
- **Performance vs. Satisfaction**: Productivity-satisfaction correlation

### 6. Data Visualization Strategy

#### **Dashboard Design Principles**
1. **Executive Overview**: High-level KPIs and trends
2. **Departmental Analysis**: Granular organizational insights
3. **Employee Segmentation**: Demographic and role-based views
4. **Predictive Indicators**: Early warning system metrics

#### **Visualization Hierarchy**
- **Level 1**: Overall company metrics and trends
- **Level 2**: Department and role-specific analysis
- **Level 3**: Individual employee characteristics and patterns
- **Level 4**: Drill-down capabilities for detailed investigation

### 7. Quality Assurance Protocols

#### **Data Validation Procedures**
```sql
-- Categorical Value Verification
SELECT DISTINCT Gender FROM employees;
SELECT DISTINCT MaritalStatus FROM employees;
SELECT DISTINCT Attrition FROM employees;

-- Numerical Range Validation
SELECT 
    MIN(Age), MAX(Age), AVG(Age),
    MIN(MonthlyIncome), MAX(MonthlyIncome), AVG(MonthlyIncome)
FROM employees;
```

#### **Consistency Checks**
- **Cross-field Validation**: Logical relationship verification
- **Range Boundaries**: Acceptable value range confirmation
- **Completeness Assessment**: Missing value analysis and treatment

### 8. Business Intelligence Framework

#### **Insight Generation Process**
1. **Pattern Identification**: Statistical trend recognition
2. **Causal Analysis**: Root cause investigation
3. **Impact Assessment**: Business effect quantification
4. **Recommendation Development**: Actionable strategy formulation

#### **Decision Support Matrix**
| Metric | Threshold | Risk Level | Action Required |
|--------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| Attrition Rate | >20% | High | Immediate intervention |
| Job Satisfaction | <2.5 | Medium | Engagement programs |
| Overtime Frequency | >30% | High | Work-life balance review |
| Salary Disparity | >25% variance | Medium | Compensation analysis |

### 9. Reporting Framework

#### **Stakeholder Communication Strategy**
- **Executive Summary**: High-level findings and recommendations
- **Departmental Reports**: Specific area analysis and actions
- **Technical Documentation**: Methodology and implementation details
- **Visual Dashboards**: Interactive exploration and monitoring tools

#### **Output Formats**
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Power BI with real-time filtering
- **Static Reports**: PDF documentation for formal presentations
- **Data Exports**: CSV files for further analysis and sharing
- **Executive Briefings**: Summary presentations for leadership

### 10. Implementation Methodology

#### **Deployment Framework**
1. **Phase 1**: Data preparation and initial analysis
2. **Phase 2**: Dashboard development and validation
3. **Phase 3**: Stakeholder training and rollout
4. **Phase 4**: Monitoring and continuous improvement

#### **Change Management Process**
