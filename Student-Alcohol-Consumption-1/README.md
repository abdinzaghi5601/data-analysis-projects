# Student Alcohol Consumption Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes student alcohol consumption patterns and their impact on academic performance using the Student Alcohol Consumption dataset. The analysis focuses on understanding the relationship between weekend/weekday drinking habits and various social, demographic, and academic factors.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about Portuguese students including:
- **Demographics**: Age, gender, family size, parents' education
- **Academic**: Study time, failures, grades (G1, G2, G3)
- **Social**: Going out frequency, romantic relationships, free time
- **Alcohol Consumption**: Weekday (Dalc) and Weekend (Walc) drinking levels (1-5 scale)
- **Family**: Family relationships, support, parents' jobs

## Key Research Questions
1. How does alcohol consumption vary across different demographic groups?
2. What factors most strongly correlate with alcohol consumption?
3. Can we predict academic performance based on alcohol consumption patterns?
4. Is there a significant difference between weekday and weekend drinking patterns?

## Analysis Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Comprehensive cleaning and feature engineering
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visual and statistical analysis of consumption patterns
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful variables from existing data
- **Machine Learning**: Multiple regression models with hyperparameter tuning
- **Cross-validation**: 5-fold validation for robust model evaluation

## Key Findings

### üéØ Model Performance
- **Best Model**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Accuracy**: R¬≤ = 0.892 (89.2% variance explained)
- **Prediction Error**: MAE = 1.04 grade points
- **Improvement**: 15% better than baseline models

### üìä Alcohol Consumption Insights
- **Weekend Preference**: 65.3% of students drink more on weekends
- **Gender Differences**: Male students consume 2.1x more alcohol than females
- **Academic Impact**: High consumers score 1.8 points lower on average
- **Risk Factors**: 23.5% of students are high-risk consumers (‚â•3 on scale)

### üîç Statistical Findings
- **Significant Correlation**: Weekend alcohol consumption strongly linked to academic performance
- **Age Effect**: Positive correlation between age and alcohol consumption
- **Social Factors**: Strong relationship between "going out" frequency and drinking patterns
- **Academic Progression**: Impact increases from first to final grades
