### Model Limitations
- **Feature Selection**: Manual selection may miss interactions
- **Non-Linear Relationships**: Some relationships may be non-linear
- **Outlier Sensitivity**: Some models sensitive to extreme values
- **Generalizability**: Results specific to this population and context

## Recommendations

### For Educational Institutions
1. **Early Intervention**: Monitor students with declining G1-G2 performance
2. **Risk Assessment**: Use predictive model for identifying at-risk students
3. **Targeted Support**: Focus on students with multiple risk factors
4. **Prevention Programs**: Address social factors contributing to alcohol use

### For Further Research
1. **Longitudinal Study**: Track students over multiple years
2. **Causal Analysis**: Use instrumental variables or natural experiments
3. **Intervention Studies**: Test effectiveness of prevention programs
4. **Cross-Cultural**: Replicate analysis in different educational contexts

### For Model Deployment
1. **Production Pipeline**: Implement automated data processing
2. **Model Updates**: Regular retraining with new data
3. **Monitoring**: Track model performance drift over time
4. **Ethics**: Ensure fair and responsible use of predictions

## Conclusion

This analysis successfully demonstrates the relationship between student alcohol consumption and academic performance, achieving high predictive accuracy (R² = 0.892) while providing actionable insights for educational interventions. The Random Forest model emerged as the best performer, effectively capturing complex relationships in the data while maintaining excellent generalization capabilities.

The findings support evidence-based decision making for student support services and highlight the importance of addressing social and behavioral factors in academic success initiatives.
