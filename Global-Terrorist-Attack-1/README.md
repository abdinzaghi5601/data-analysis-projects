# Global Terrorism Database Analysis

## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global terrorism patterns using the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) spanning from 1970 to 2017. The analysis employs advanced machine learning techniques to understand, predict, and provide actionable insights about terrorist activities worldwide.

## Dataset Description
The Global Terrorism Database contains detailed information about **181,691 terrorist incidents** with **135+ features** including:

- **Casualty Information**: Number killed, wounded, and total casualties
- **Attack Details**: Success rate, property damage, group responsibility
- **Contextual Factors**: Political, economic, and social variables

## Key Research Questions
1. **Can we predict whether a terrorist attack will be successful?**
2. **How many casualties will a terrorist incident cause?**
3. **What are the primary factors driving terrorist attack success and lethality?**
