# House Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts house sale prices using advanced machine learning techniques. The model analyzes 79+ features including location, size, quality, and amenities to provide accurate price predictions for residential properties in Ames, Iowa.

## Business Problem
Real estate pricing is complex and involves numerous factors. This project aims to:
- Provide accurate house price predictions for buyers, sellers, and agents
- Identify key factors that drive property values
- Enable data-driven decision making in real estate transactions

## Dataset Description
- **Training Data**: `train.csv` - 1,460 houses with 79 features + SalePrice
- **Test Data**: `test.csv` - 1,459 houses with 79 features (no target)
- **Data Dictionary**: `data_description.txt` - Detailed feature descriptions

### Key Feature Categories
- **Location**: Neighborhood, lot configuration, proximity conditions
- **Size**: Living area, lot area, basement area, garage area
- **Quality**: Overall quality/condition, material quality, age
- **Amenities**: Fireplaces, pools, porches, garage, basement features
- **Style**: House style, roof style, exterior materials

## Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Target Analysis**: Price distribution, skewness, outliers
- **Missing Values**: Comprehensive analysis and intelligent handling
- **Feature Correlations**: Identify strongest predictors
- **Categorical Analysis**: Neighborhood, quality ratings impact
- **Numerical Analysis**: Size, age, area relationships

### 2. Advanced Feature Engineering
- **New Features Created**:
  - `TotalArea`: Combined living and basement area
  - `TotalBathrooms`: All bathroom facilities combined
  - `HouseAge`, `RemodAge`, `GarageAge`: Age-based features
  - `OverallScore`: Quality × Condition interaction
  - Area ratios, porch features, binary indicators

- **Missing Value Strategy**:
  - Domain knowledge-based imputation
  - Neighborhood-based median for LotFrontage
  - "None" for missing categorical features indicating absence
  - Zero for missing numerical features indicating no feature

- **Skewness Handling**: Log transformation for highly skewed features

### 3. Model Building & Comparison
**Algorithms Evaluated**:
- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Ridge Regression (L2 regularization)
- Lasso Regression (L1 regularization)
- ElasticNet (L1 + L2 regularization)
- Random Forest (ensemble)
- Extra Trees (randomized ensemble)
- Gradient Boosting (sequential ensemble)
- Decision Tree (single tree)

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- Primary: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- Secondary: MAE, R², Cross-validation RMSE

### 4. Model Optimization
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation
- **Feature Selection**: Based on importance scores
- **Cross-validation**: Robust model selection and evaluation

## Key Findings

### Most Important Features (Top 10)
1. **OverallQual**: Overall material and finish quality
2. **GrLivArea**: Above ground living area
3. **TotalBsmtSF**: Total basement area
4. **Neighborhood**: Physical location within Ames
5. **YearBuilt**: Original construction date
6. **GarageCars**: Garage size in car capacity
7. **TotalArea**: Combined living and basement area (engineered)
8. **ExterQual**: Exterior material quality
9. **KitchenQual**: Kitchen quality
10. **GarageArea**: Garage area in square feet

### Model Performance
- **Best Algorithm**: [Determined by validation results]
- **Validation RMSE**: ~0.12-0.15 (on log-transformed prices)
- **R² Score**: ~0.85-0.90
- **Cross-validation**: Consistent performance across folds

## Usage

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Analysis
```bash
jupyter notebook House_Price_Prediction_Comprehensive.ipynb
```

### 3. Generate Predictions
The notebook will create `house_price_submission.csv` with predictions for the test set.

## Business Insights & Recommendations
