# Customer Satisfaction Analysis - Methodology & Technical Framework

## ðŸ“‹ Analytical Methodology

### 1. Customer Feedback Data Collection

#### **Data Source Characteristics**
- **Business Context**: Kashmir Cafe customer satisfaction survey
- **Records**: 10,600+ customer feedback responses
- **Scope**: Multi-dimensional customer experience evaluation
- **Response Scale**: 1-5 Likert scale for satisfaction metrics
- **Survey Dimensions**: Delivery experience, food quality, delivery speed, order accuracy

#### **Customer Survey Design Framework**
```sql
-- Survey Data Structure
CREATE TABLE survey_data (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    delivery_satisfaction INT,           -- 1-5 scale
    food_quality_satisfaction INT,       -- 1-5 scale
    delivery_time_satisfaction INT,      -- 1-5 scale
    order_accuracy VARCHAR(10),         -- Yes/No
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 2. Data Quality Assessment Framework

#### **Missing Value Analysis Protocol**
```sql
-- Comprehensive Missing Data Assessment
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM survey_data 
WHERE delivery_satisfaction IS NULL 
   OR food_quality_satisfaction IS NULL 
   OR delivery_time_satisfaction IS NULL;

-- Order Accuracy Completeness Analysis
SELECT 
    COALESCE(order_accuracy, 'blank') AS accuracy_status,
    COUNT(*) AS count,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM survey_data), 1) AS percentage
FROM survey_data
GROUP BY accuracy_status;
```

#### **Data Integrity Validation**
- **Rating Range Validation**: Ensured all ratings fall within 1-5 scale
- **Logical Consistency**: Verified relationship between accuracy and satisfaction
- **Temporal Validation**: Checked timestamp consistency and patterns

### 3. Customer Satisfaction Categorization

#### **Satisfaction Level Framework**
```sql
-- Multi-Dimensional Satisfaction Categorization
CREATE VIEW customer_satisfaction_analysis AS
SELECT 
    id,
    delivery_satisfaction,
    food_quality_satisfaction,
    delivery_time_satisfaction,
    order_accuracy,
    CASE 
        WHEN delivery_satisfaction >= 4 THEN 'High'
        WHEN delivery_satisfaction >= 2 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Low'
    END AS delivery_satisfaction_level,
    CASE 
        WHEN food_quality_satisfaction >= 4 THEN 'High'
        WHEN food_quality_satisfaction >= 2 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Low'
    END AS food_quality_level
FROM survey_data;
```

#### **Satisfaction Thresholds**
- **High Satisfaction**: Ratings 4-5 (Satisfied to Very Satisfied)
- **Medium Satisfaction**: Ratings 2-3 (Neutral to Somewhat Satisfied)
- **Low Satisfaction**: Rating 1 (Very Dissatisfied)

### 4. Statistical Analysis Framework

#### **Customer Distribution Analysis**
```sql
-- Overall Customer Satisfaction Metrics
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS total_customers,
    AVG(delivery_satisfaction) AS avg_delivery_satisfaction,
    AVG(food_quality_satisfaction) AS avg_food_quality,
    AVG(delivery_time_satisfaction) AS avg_delivery_time_satisfaction
FROM survey_data;
```

#### **Correlation Analysis Methodology**
```sql
-- Food Quality vs Delivery Speed Correlation
SELECT 
    ROUND(
        (
            COUNT(*) * SUM(food_quality_satisfaction * delivery_time_satisfaction) - 
            SUM(food_quality_satisfaction) * SUM(delivery_time_satisfaction)
        ) / 
        (
            SQRT(
                COUNT(*) * SUM(food_quality_satisfaction * food_quality_satisfaction) - 
                POW(SUM(food_quality_satisfaction), 2)
            ) * 
            SQRT(
                COUNT(*) * SUM(delivery_time_satisfaction * delivery_time_satisfaction) - 
                POW(SUM(delivery_time_satisfaction), 2)
            )
        ), 
    2) AS correlation_coefficient
FROM survey_data;
```

### 5. Customer Experience Analytics

#### **Order Accuracy Impact Analysis**
```sql
-- Satisfaction Metrics by Order Accuracy
SELECT 
    order_accuracy,
    COUNT(*) AS order_count,
    AVG(delivery_satisfaction) AS avg_delivery_satisfaction,
    AVG(food_quality_satisfaction) AS avg_food_quality,
    AVG(delivery_time_satisfaction) AS avg_delivery_time_satisfaction
FROM survey_data
GROUP BY order_accuracy
ORDER BY order_accuracy;
```

#### **Multi-Dimensional Rating Distribution**
- **Delivery Experience**: Distribution analysis across 1-5 rating scale
- **Food Quality**: Quality perception patterns and variations
- **Delivery Speed**: Time satisfaction correlation with overall experience
- **Order Accuracy**: Binary accuracy impact on satisfaction dimensions

### 6. Temporal Pattern Analysis

#### **Time-Based Satisfaction Trends**
```sql
-- Weekly Satisfaction Trend Analysis
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(created_at, '%Y-%u') AS week,
    AVG(delivery_satisfaction) AS avg_delivery,
    AVG(food_quality_satisfaction) AS avg_food,
    AVG(delivery_time_satisfaction) AS avg_delivery_time,
    COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM survey_data
GROUP BY week
ORDER BY week;

-- Hourly Pattern Analysis
SELECT 
    HOUR(created_at) AS hour_of_day,
    AVG(delivery_satisfaction) AS avg_delivery_satisfaction,
    COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM survey_data
GROUP BY hour_of_day
ORDER BY hour_of_day;
```
