- **Records**: 55,501+ patient encounters
- **Scope**: Multi-hospital healthcare system analysis
- **Time Frame**: Multi-year patient care data (2019-2024)
- **Compliance**: Healthcare data privacy considerations

#### **Data Quality Assessment Protocol**
```sql
-- Missing Values Analysis
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS total_records,
    COUNT(*) - COUNT(name) AS missing_names,
    COUNT(*) - COUNT(age) AS missing_ages,
    COUNT(*) - COUNT(gender) AS missing_genders,
    COUNT(*) - COUNT(medical_condition) AS missing_conditions,
    COUNT(*) - COUNT(admission_date) AS missing_admission_dates,
    COUNT(*) - COUNT(billing_amount) AS missing_billing_amounts
FROM hospitalrecords;
```

### 2. Data Cleaning Framework

#### **Duplicate Elimination Strategy**
```sql
-- DISTINCT Records Method for Healthcare Data
CREATE TABLE temp_hospital_records AS
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM hospitalrecords;

DROP TABLE hospitalrecords;
RENAME TABLE temp_hospital_records TO hospitalrecords;
```

#### **Healthcare-Specific Data Standardization**

- **Medical Conditions**: Standardized diagnosis coding and terminology
- **Financial Data**: Currency standardization and decimal formatting
- **Temporal Data**: Date validation and stay duration calculations

### 3. Healthcare Feature Engineering

#### **Clinical Metrics Derivation**
```sql
-- Hospital Stay Duration Calculation
ALTER TABLE hospitalrecords ADD COLUMN stay_days INT;
UPDATE hospitalrecords
SET stay_days = DATEDIFF(
    IFNULL(discharge_date, CURDATE()), 
    admission_date
);

-- Age Group Clinical Classification
ALTER TABLE hospitalrecords ADD COLUMN age_group VARCHAR(20);
UPDATE hospitalrecords
SET age_group = 
    CASE 
        WHEN age < 18 THEN '0-17 (Pediatric)'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 18 AND 30 THEN '18-30 (Young Adult)'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 31 AND 50 THEN '31-50 (Adult)'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 51 AND 65 THEN '51-65 (Senior)'
        ELSE '66+ (Elderly)'
    END;
```

    ROUND(AVG(billing_amount), 2) AS avg_cost_per_case
FROM hospitalrecords
GROUP BY medical_condition
ORDER BY case_count DESC;
```

#### **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**
```sql
-- Treatment Cost Analysis by Condition
SELECT 
    medical_condition,
    ROUND(AVG(stay_days), 1) AS avg_length_of_stay,
    ROUND(AVG(billing_amount), 2) AS avg_total_cost,
    ROUND(AVG(billing_amount)/AVG(stay_days), 2) AS cost_per_day
FROM hospitalrecords
WHERE discharge_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY medical_condition
ORDER BY avg_total_cost DESC;
```
