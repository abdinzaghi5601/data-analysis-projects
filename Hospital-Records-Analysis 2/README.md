## 🔧 Data Preparation Process

### **Data Cleaning Procedures**
- **Duplicate Removal**: Used DISTINCT records approach to eliminate duplicates
- **Column Standardization**: Renamed columns to snake_case format for consistency
- **Missing Value Treatment**: Applied IFNULL and default values for incomplete records

### **Data Transformation**
```sql
-- Gender Standardization
UPDATE hospitalrecords
SET gender = CASE 
    WHEN LOWER(gender) IN ('m', 'male') THEN 'Male'
    WHEN LOWER(gender) IN ('f', 'female') THEN 'Female'
    ELSE 'Other/Unknown' 
END;

-- Age Group Creation
UPDATE hospitalrecords
SET age_group = 
    CASE 
        WHEN age < 18 THEN '0-17 (Pediatric)'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 18 AND 30 THEN '18-30 (Young Adult)'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 31 AND 50 THEN '31-50 (Adult)'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 51 AND 65 THEN '51-65 (Senior)'
        ELSE '66+ (Elderly)'
    END;

-- Hospital Stay Calculation
UPDATE hospitalrecords
SET stay_days = DATEDIFF(
    IFNULL(discharge_date, CURDATE()), 
    admission_date
);
```

### **Quality Assurance**
- **Data Validation**: Ensured all critical fields are populated
- **Constraint Implementation**: Added NOT NULL constraints for essential columns
- **Format Standardization**: Converted billing amounts to standard decimal format
