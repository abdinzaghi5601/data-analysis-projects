# Healthcare Dataset Transformation Summary

## Overview
Successfully transformed the hospital records dataset to align with the SQL code requirements. The dataset now features standardized column names, derived fields, and improved data quality.

## Dataset Statistics
- **Total Records**: 55,500 patient records
- **Data Quality**: 100% complete (no missing data)
- **Age Validation**: All ages within valid range (0-120 years)

## Column Transformations Applied

### Original → Standardized Column Names
| Original CSV Column | Standardized SQL Column |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| `Name` | `name` |
| `Age` | `age` |
| `Gender` | `gender` |
| `Blood Type` | `blood_type` |
| `Medical Condition` | `medical_condition` |
| `Date of Admission` | `admission_date` |
| `Doctor` | `doctor` |
| `Hospital` | `hospital` |
| `Insurance Provider` | `insurance_provider` |
| `Billing Amount` | `billing_amount` |
| `Room Number` | `room_number` |
| `Admission Type` | `admission_type` |
| `Discharge Date` | `discharge_date` |
| `Medication` | `medication` |
| `Test Results` | `test_results` |

### New Derived Columns Created
| Column Name | Description | Business Purpose |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| `stay_days` | Calculated hospital stay duration | Operational efficiency metrics |
| `age_group` | Age categorization (Pediatric, Young Adult, Adult, Senior, Elderly) | Demographic analysis |
| `cost_category` | Cost classification (Low, Medium, High, Very High) | Financial analysis |
| `admission_year` | Year extracted from admission date | Temporal analysis |
| `admission_month` | Month extracted from admission date | Seasonal pattern analysis |

## Data Quality Improvements

### Demographics Distribution
- **Gender**: 50.0% Male, 50.0% Female (perfectly balanced)
- **Age Groups**: 
  - 29.3% Elderly (66+)
  - 29.4% Adult (31-50)
  - 22.4% Senior (51-65)
  - 18.7% Young Adult (18-30)
  - 0.2% Pediatric (0-17)

### Cost Analysis
- **Cost Categories**:
  - 60.5% High Cost ($20K-$50K)
  - 30.4% Medium Cost ($5K-$20K)
  - 8.2% Low Cost (<$5K)
  - 0.8% Very High Cost (>$50K)

### Data Standardization
- ✅ Patient names standardized to Title Case
- ✅ Gender values normalized to Male/Female
- ✅ Insurance provider defaults to 'Self-pay' for missing values
- ✅ Room numbers default to 'Unknown' for missing values
- ✅ Date format standardized to YYYY-MM-DD

## SQL Code Enhancements

### Task Structure Updates
All 8 tasks now include:
- **Task Description**: Clear explanation of what the task does
- **Business Purpose**: Why this analysis is important
- **Expected Outcome**: What results to expect

### Tasks Overview
1. **Database Setup**: Initialize database and import processed data
2. **Data Standardization**: Validate quality and create derived fields
3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Demographics and medical condition patterns
4. **Financial Analytics**: Cost drivers and insurance coverage analysis
5. **Operations Analysis**: Hospital performance and resource utilization
6. **Treatment Analysis**: Medication patterns and effectiveness
7. **Risk Assessment**: Patient risk stratification and predictive insights
8. **Business Intelligence**: Dashboard views and executive summaries

## Files Created
- `healthcare_dataset_processed.csv` - Transformed dataset (55,500 records)
- `Health Records.sql` - Updated SQL script with proper formatting
- `DATA_TRANSFORMATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Next Steps
1. Import the processed CSV file into your MySQL database
2. Run the SQL queries to generate healthcare analytics
3. Use the results for business intelligence and decision making

## Database Import Command
```sql
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'healthcare_dataset_processed.csv' 
INTO TABLE hospitalrecords 
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"' 
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' 
IGNORE 1 ROWS;
```

The dataset is now fully compatible with the SQL analytics framework and ready for comprehensive healthcare business intelligence analysis.
