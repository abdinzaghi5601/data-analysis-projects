    DepartureTime = REPLACE(DepartureTime, '24:', '00:'),
    ArrivalTime = REPLACE(ArrivalTime, '24:', '00:')
WHERE DepartureTime LIKE '24:%' OR ArrivalTime LIKE '24:%';

-- Convert to proper datetime format
UPDATE airlinedata
SET 
    formatted_flightdate = STR_TO_DATE(FlightDate, '%Y-%m-%d'),
    formatted_departure = STR_TO_DATE(CONCAT(FlightDate, ' ', DepartureTime), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s'),
