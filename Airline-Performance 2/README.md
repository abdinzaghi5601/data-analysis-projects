ADD COLUMN formatted_departure DATETIME,
ADD COLUMN formatted_arrival DATETIME;

UPDATE airlinedata
SET 
    formatted_flightdate = STR_TO_DATE(FlightDate, '%Y-%m-%d'),
    formatted_departure = STR_TO_DATE(CONCAT(FlightDate, ' ', DepartureTime), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s'),
    formatted_arrival = STR_TO_DATE(CONCAT(FlightDate, ' ', ArrivalTime), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s');

-- Delay categorization
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN ArrDelay > 0 THEN 'Arrival Delay'
        WHEN DepDelay > 0 THEN 'Departure Delay'
        ELSE 'On Time'
    END AS delay_type,
